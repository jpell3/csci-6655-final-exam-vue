## CSCI 6655 - Web-Database Application Development - Fall 2023 || Final Project
-----------------------------------------------------
The objective of this project was to test my knowledge in both Frontend and Backend development. In this project, I was asked to create a frontend application using Vue.js and set up a backend server using Node.js.

An abstract view of your final project: 

![finalproject](https://github.com/jpell3/csci-6655-final-exam-server/assets/36427403/17abd431-2291-4724-846e-24b937af2a6b)

There were three major deliverable components in this project:

  (1) Wireframe: A wireframe was required for the front end Vue.js application.
  
**  (2) Front End: I was asked to create a front end application using Vue.js, HTML5, CSS3 (utilizing flex or grid), and Javascript. The requirements were:  
    - The application needed to be a single-page application.  
    - The application must be developed using Vue.js.  
    - The application should be broken down into at least more than two components (excluding the root component).  
    - The application must have data passing from one component to its child component.  
    - The data must be coming from your Node Server deployed using Netlify (or any other platform you would like to host your Node server, but must **NOT** be in LOCALHOST).  
    - The application should access data from the server regardless of the host station running the program.  
    - The application must have more than three (3) types of data, and must fetch more than five (5) entries.  **
  
  (3) Back End: A Node.js server needed to be created and deployed to a web service or our choice. The requirements were:  
    - The homepage must be a portfolio website that was created previously in the semester. This should be accessable from '/', 'index', or 'index/html'.  
    - The API data must be served from '/api', so that it can be accessed from the front end application.  
    - A public folder should contain the portfolio website and JSON file.  

  (4) MongoDB (optional): If desired, data can be imported to MongoDB and retreived by the server to host on the Node.js server API.
