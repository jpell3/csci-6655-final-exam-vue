# CSCI 6655: Web-Database Application Development - Final Project

The objective of this project was to test my knowledge in both Frontend and Backend development. In this project, I was asked to create a frontend application using Vue.js and set up a backend server using Node.js.

## Deliverables

There were three major deliverable components and one optional component in this project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository contains only the FrontEnd deliverable. See the **Related Repositories** section for more information.

### Wireframe

A wireframe was required for the front-end Vue.js application.

> [!TIP]
> View using the '/wireframe' or '/wireframe.html' endpoint on the BackEnd.

### FrontEnd

I was asked to create a front-end application using Vue.js, HTML5, CSS3 (utilizing flex or grid), and Javascript. The requirements were:

- The application needed to be a single-page application.
- The application must be developed using Vue.js.
- The application should be broken down into at least more than two components (excluding the root component).
- The application must have data passing from one component to its child component.
- The data must be coming from your Node Server deployed using Netlify (or any other platform you would like to host your Node server, but must **NOT** be in LOCALHOST).
- The application should access data from the server regardless of the host station running the program.
- The application must have more than three (3) types of data and must fetch more than five (5) entries.

### BackEnd

A Node.js server needed to be created and deployed to a web service of our choice. The requirements were:

- The homepage must be a portfolio website that was created previously in the semester. This should be accessible from '/', 'index', or 'index/html'.
- The API data must be served from '/api' so that it can be accessed from the front-end application.
- A public folder should contain the portfolio website and JSON file.

> Available endpoints include: /index.html -- /wireframe.html -- /api

### MongoDB (optional)

If desired, data can be imported to MongoDB and retrieved by the server to host on the Node.js server API.
